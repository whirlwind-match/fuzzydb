/**
 * A weak reference holder for the an object being used as the key to a map.
 * Key hash/equality is done using System.identityHashCode().
 * Equality is that two keys refer to the same object instance (i.e. not just clones).  
 * 
 * FIXME: I think there is a bug here, in that hashcode is only computed once, but the referent may
 * be modified.  Thus the hashcode may have changed, but the referred object is actually the same
 * one.  It seems possible to put two references to the object into the map.
