/**
 * WorkerThreadManager is responsible for ensuring that a limited (usually = cpu count)
 * number of WorkerThreads can be operating concurrently, and that if one gets blocked 
 * waiting for I/O, further threads can be released to keep the CPU busy.
 * This ensures that the correct number of threads is running at any one time.
 * 
 * TODO: This is convoluted and difficult to interact with. e.g. MaintThread wants to 
 * be able to act when there are no transactions in progress.  It is required to implement
 * it's own locking and scheduling.
 * Perhaps a better approach would be to allow jobs to be submitted as different classes:
 * - ExclusiveJob - requires all the permits
 * - ScalableJob - gets specified number of threads (CPU count), only releasing new threads 
 * when the server blocks on I/O.
 * A scheduled job, such as like server maintenance would also require some re-scheduling.
 * ... not an easy web to weave ...
 * 
 * Perhaps our implementation would benefit from using Latches or AtomicInteger. See
 * Effective Java chapter on Concurrency.
