		// - If a scorer is ForwardsOnly, and the trigger attribute does not exist, then we can eliminate it
		// - If it scores both ways, and the attribute doesn't exist in the search, then we can use the reverse only variant
		// - If it is a Boolean, we can use a fixedBooleanScorer hard-coded for a search for true or for false - thus saving
		// the need to refer to the search attrs
		// A similar strategy to the boolean can be done for a float and float range preference... in fact even without
		// the step of eliminating any unused scorers, we can merge all the search attributes into a merged ScoreConfiguration
		// which uses only scorers that refer to the attribute in the database, not those in the search.
		// The attributes in that scorer can be given a "final" keyword too, which would allow the compiler to 
		// assume that the value never changes.
