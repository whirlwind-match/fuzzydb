 * Interface to an object that represents a range of values that may or may not match.
 * Specified cases include:
 * - a range of values (e.g. 0.5 to 0.75, or Red, Blue, White (enum) )
 * - a range of values plus the 'not specified' case (the null case should either succeed or fail somewhere)
 * - no values, just a match on 'not specified'.
 * 
 * SOME USEFUL COMMENTS FOUND SOMEWHERE RELATING TO OLD BranchConstraint/NodeAnnotation IMPL         
 *  na == null All Items under this node have null for this attribute
 *  na.hasValue() do any Items under this node have this attribute
 *  na.isIncludesNotSpecified Some Items under this node have null for this attribute
 *  
 *  NOW:  na == null -> same meaning (that attribute doesn't exist anywhere
 *        na != null -> some or all non-nulls exist below
 *        na.isIncludesNotSpecified -> also has nulls
