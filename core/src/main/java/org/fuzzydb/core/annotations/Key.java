/**
 * Used to mark an Index field.
 * Works on all Comparable and primitive types except boolean.
 * The Mode (Ref or Value) determines how each instance is placed in the index. Value causes a copy of the entire object to be
 * placed in the index, improving the performance when retrieving many objects. Ref causes the index to reference the object in its class table,
 * which requires one additional lookup by ref for each retrieved object. This is almost as fast when only retrieving one object.
 * 
 * When lookups will normally be done by equality and single objects retrieved, ie with id's, use Ref.
 * When ranges of keys will be looked up to return collections, use Value.
